## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am a back-end developer with a strong focus on building efficient, scalable APIs using Java Spring Boot, MongoDB, and cloud services like AWS Lambda. I specialize in creating robust server-side solutions that handle high-volume requests, ensure data integrity, and integrate seamlessly with other services.

Spring Boot is my framework of choice for building enterprise-level applications. I appreciate its ease of use, flexibility, and the vast ecosystem of libraries that streamline back-end development. With Spring Boot, I can quickly set up RESTful APIs, handle authentication and authorization, and build microservices architectures that scale with ease. Itâ€™s a powerful framework that allows me to deliver clean, maintainable, and secure back-end solutions.

For data management, I work with MongoDB, a NoSQL database that provides flexibility in managing unstructured data. MongoDBâ€™s ability to scale horizontally and handle large datasets makes it an ideal choice for applications with high data throughput. I am experienced in designing efficient database schemas, creating complex queries, and ensuring fast, reliable data access.

In addition to my work with Spring Boot and MongoDB, I have experience integrating cloud services like AWS Lambda to build serverless architectures. AWS Lambda allows me to run code without provisioning servers, reducing operational overhead and improving scalability. I use Lambda to create event-driven systems, handle background tasks, and integrate with other AWS services like S3 and DynamoDB for seamless data processing.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find projects that showcase my work with Java Spring Boot, MongoDB, and cloud services like AWS Lambda. Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or discuss any of the projects. Iâ€™m always eager to learn and improve as a back-end developer!
